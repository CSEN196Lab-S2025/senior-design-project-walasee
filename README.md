BEFORE YOU MAKE ANY CHANGES TO YOUR CODE rebase your git branch using commands below:
git fetch origin
git checkout your-branch
git rebase origin/main 

AFTER YOU MAKE CHANGES TO YOUR CODE:
commit changes to your local branch
publish to your online branch
make a pull request
and finally merge all changes to the main.
(idk the commands, figure it out lmao, or use github desktop)
