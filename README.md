# Revit WalaSee
SCU Senior Design 2024-25, Revit WalaSee

In this project, we use the Walabot (an RF-powered stud finder) to collect wall interior data and generate 3D models of pipes behind the wall using our custom software. This helps reduce construction waste and improve safety for retrofits, especially in buildings without blueprints or BIMs.
