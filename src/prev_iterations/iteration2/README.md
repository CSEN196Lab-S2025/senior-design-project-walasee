ITERATION 2
- In this iteration we had an understanding of how to trigger the device with Python code, but for the majority of the time we did not have a test wall. Thus, it was difficult to determine exactly how the Walabot works (i.e. we didn't know that the Walabot hardware does not have the ability to xyz relative to one spot ??? someone pls help me explain this better)
- Edited the InWallApp.py program so that it prints out the information the Walabot receives. Specifically, it prints the x, y, and z coordinates when it detects something (metal pipe, pvc pipe) behind the wall. The coordinates are then saved to a .txt or .csv file depending on which program you run. There is one program to run depending on what file type we need. Added this variation because .csv allows the datapoints to be accessed as integers/floats and in .txt everything is a string. Also created a Jupyter Notebook program that helps visualize the collected xyz coordinates. It generates a 2D xy axis plot and an interactive 3D xyz plot. 
- There is a bash script to help automatically run the plotting program against all outputted xyz .txt files we have
